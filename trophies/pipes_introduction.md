# Pipes Introduction

Pipes are not a well known Scapy feature. They can be used to chain actions such
as sniffing, modifying and printing packets.

This trophy provides simple examples that builds on a silly one that does
nothing.

## Tasks

**task #1**

- edit the `pipe_trophy.py` template
- add a `ConsoleSink()` named cs
- redirect clfs to cs (with the '>' operator)
- launch the script

**task #2**

- remove the clfs to cs redirection
- add a `TransformDrain()` named td that uses `transform_f()`
- add a `InjectSink()` named ijs
- redirect clfs to td, and td to ijs
- test it:
  - sniff the network
  - launch the script

**task #3**

- add a `WrpcapSink()` named ws
- redirect td to ws
- sniff the network and check for a newly created PCAP file
- launch the script


## Hints

- in Scapy sources, the files `pipetool.py` and `scapypipes.py` give you all you
  need to know about pipes related objects
- a Sink is the last element of a pipe,  a Drain 'manipulates' data and forwards
  it
