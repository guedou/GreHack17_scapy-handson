# Playing with TLS

This trophy shows you some cool things that you can do.

## Tasks

**task #1**

- load the `tls` layer with `load_layer()`
- use `sniff` to capture some HTTPS traffic (i.e. 443/tcp)
- filter packets that have a `TLS` object
- identify a ClientHello or a ServerHello message
- display the ciphersuites

## Hints

- the TAB key can be use to find Scapy layers names!
