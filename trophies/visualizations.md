# Visualizations

This trophy shows you some Scapy visualization tools.

## Tasks

**task #1**

- create the packet of your choice
- use `raw()` and `hexdump()` to show the build packet values
- call `show()` and `show2()` on the packet and notice the differences
- call `pdfdump()` or `canvas_dump()`

**task #2**

- use `srloop()` to send 100 packets to `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`
- call `multiplot()` on the resulting packets list and plot IP id

**task #3**

- use the `traceroute()` function to get the patch to two different targets
- try the `world_trace()` and `trace3D()` methods

## Hints

- check the help of `multiplot()` and `traceroute()`
